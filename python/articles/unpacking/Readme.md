# Unpacking

In my article on [args_kwargs](../args_kwargs/) we could looked at the * and ** operators and how they can be used. In this article I am going to closely look once again at the * and ** operators from a slightly different perspective.

# Tuple Unpacking

Tuples can be unpacked quite quickly, let's set up an app, as always we will write tests first then write the accompanying code.

## App

Create the following app structure

```
app/
|--tests/
|----__init__.py
|----test_tuple_unpack.py
|--functions/
|-----typle_unpack.py
|--requirements.txt
```

.....in progress.....
