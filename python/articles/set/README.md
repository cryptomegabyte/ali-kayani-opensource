# Set

Here I look at the fundamentals around sets.

`python -m venv venv` will create a virtual environment.

`. venv/bin/activate` will activate that virtual environment.

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` will install pytest.

Run `pytest` and the tests should pass. Examine the tests and the code.
