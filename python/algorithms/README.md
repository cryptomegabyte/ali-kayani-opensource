# Algorithms

In this section I examine interesting algorithms which have challenged my thinking.

Each algorithm can be run by simply by:

1. `python -m venv venv`. Install a venv.
2. `. venv/bin/activate`. Activate the venv
3. `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. Install the requirments.
4. `pytest` - Executes the tests.


## [Caesar](/python/algorithms/caesar/)

Caesar encoded his messages to his armies. Each letter in the alphabet was shifted by three. Here, I use a test first approach and examine how `Caesar's` algorithm can be implemented.
