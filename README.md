Hi tech community, for a long time i have been wanting to create something like this where i can share my thoughts through knowledge articles, build actual sofware projects using TDD and to build devops projects.

The aim of this repo is:

1. To Give back to the wider tech community by sharing skills and knowledge.
2. To demonstrate my software skills to future employers.
3. To demonstrate my devops skills to future employers.
4. To build resuable components which can be shared.

Feel free to use anything you see here in your own projects.
